This namespace contains the PIDA schema for PURLs pertaining to controlled vocabularies generated by `VocPopuli`.

`VocPopuli` is a software for the collaborative development of FAIR[^1] vocabularies.
Each vocabulary generated with the help of `VocPopuli` can be published to https://www.gitlab.com using a `SKOS`[^2] serialization. This process assigns PIDs suported by PIDA to each term in the given vocabulary, as well as to the entire vocabulary itself.
Depending on the specific user needs, one can either request a machine-readable version of the respective resource (as a `.ttl` or a `.jsonld` file) or a human-readable. This is done using the PIDs managed by PIDA.

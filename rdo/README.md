# Reference Dataset Ontology

## Overview
The Reference Dataset Ontology describes general concepts, which are related to a reference dataset, including aspects of referencing, documentation and certification. The reference can be digital, bibliographical or material. The dataset can be related to any domain. This version encompasses datasets related to the domain of Material Science, and therefore also the concept of a reference material. The purpose of the Reference Dataset Ontology is to describe concepts, which are required to qualify a dataset as a reference dataset.

### Artifact name
PTRO Ontology – Preclinical Trials in Radiation Oncology.

### Overview
The PTRO ontology is a domain-specific ontology designed to standardize, structure, and semantically represent preclinical trial data in radiation oncology. It facilitates the integration and querying information organized according the [SEND](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/send) standard. The ontology is currently being validated using a [virtual knowledge graph approach](https://ontop-vkg.org/), enabling access to datasets available on the [RadPlanBio](https://helmholtz.software/software/radplanbio) platform.
